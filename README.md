# SurvTrans
This tool is meant to automate the process of transforming datafiles to fit the requirements of survival analysis in R (package Survival).
When doing experiments requiring survival analysis, we often keep track of how many individuals die per day. However, R wants a seperate row per individual. As I often work with more than 6000 individuals for an experiment, doing this typing by hand is not only inefficient, but also prone to mistakes.

For that reason (and to learn how to code), I started this project.
